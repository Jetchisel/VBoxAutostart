.SH "NAME"
\fBsystemd-vboxinit\fR - auto start/save of vbox vms during boot, shutdown and reboot of the host.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsystemd-vboxinit\fR [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSystemd-vboxinit\fR is a script that manage \fBVirtualBox\fR's vms to auto start and auto save. It can be a group of
vms or a single unit. Using \fBsystemd\fR it can autostart and autosave the vms upon reboot and shutdown of
the host machine.  Derived from \fBvboxinit\fR which came from the phpvirtualbox project which is based on
\fBvboxtool\fR. It is used for the legacy \fBsystem V\fR (init) startup  daemon. This is the modified/rewritten
version for \fBOpenSuSE\fR with \fBsystemd\fR as it's startup daemon. ( which should work for other distro's
which is using \fBsystemd\fR ).

.SH OPTIONS
  \fB-s\fR, \fB--start\fR    Start enabled virtual machines otherwise show the state.
  \fB-x\fR, \fB--stop\fR     Save the state of all running virtual machines enabled or not.
  \fB-d\fR, \fB--disable\fR  Like stop but also stops the vbox daemons, useful before a vbox update.
  \fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR     Show this help.
  \fB-a\fR, \fB--about\fR    A brief info.
  \fB-l\fR, \fB--license\fR  Show license.

.SH CONFIGURATION
At creation time of the vms the \fBextradata\fR with the key \fBpvbx/startupMode\fR has no value ( Which is ignored ).
One need's to enable it by adding the \fBauto\fR ( see \fBUSING VBOXMANAGE\fR section. ) flag to the virtual machines
in order for it  auto boot and auto save during startup and shutdown or reboot of the host. The virtual
machines are run in the background. ( which is what a daemon is all about :-) ). One can access the virtual
machines ( depending on the network type/setup which is outside the scope of this manual, see \fBVBoxManage\fR or
the virtualbox manual ) by using \fBssh(1)\fR or with the gui tools such as \fBKrdc\fR for \fBKDE\fR and the equivalent for other
DE's and of course \fBphpvirtualbox\fR itself which is very well documented, see \fBhttps://github.com/phpvirtualbox/phpvirtualbox/wiki\fR
A lot of existing tools can be used as well, one just need to do the proper networking
setup.

.SH USING VBOXMANAGE
.TP
List the vms.

.B  VBoxManage list vms
.br
.TP
Set the \fBauto\fR flag to the vms.

.B  VBoxManage setextradata bar pvbx/startupMode auto
.br
.TP
Set the \fBmanual\fR flag to the vms.

.B  VBoxManage setextradata bar pvbx/startupMode manual

.TP
Where \fBbar\fR is the name of the virtual machine which you can get from \fBVBoxManage list vms\fR, see \fBVBoxManage\fR.

.SH NOTE
It is not recommended to run \fBsystemd-vboxinit\fR with root's right such as running it with the all time favorite
sudo utility. Once one have set the \fBauto\fR flag to the virtual machines one can test it. One should invoke it
as a normal user that belongs to the \fBvboxusers\fR group.

.B /usr/lib/systemd-vboxinit.d/systemd-vboxinit --start

.B /usr/lib/systemd-vboxinit.d/systemd-vboxinit --stop

One should see the virtual machines starting and saving state. If that succeeded one should restart and enable
the daemon and reboot.

.SH USING THE DAEMON
.TP
Start the service.

.B systemctl start VBoxAutostart@foo.service

.TP
Enable the service. (start at boot time and stop during shutdown or reboot of the host machine.)

.B  systemctl enable VBoxAutostart@foo.service

.TP
Check the status of the service

.B  systemctl status VBoxAutostart@foo.service

.TP
Restart the service

.B  systemctl restart VBoxAutostart@foo.service

Where \fBfoo\fR is the username of the user who will use \fBsystemd-vboxinit\fR. For multi-user one need's to start and
enable the daemon with the specific username. One should consider the resources such as memory,cpu to be
sufficient enough for both the host and the guest.

.SH LOGGING
To check the logs for the service.
.B  journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=VBoxAutostart@foo.service
Where \fBfoo\fR is the username.

.br
For a persistent logging of \fBjournalctl\fR e.g. you want to keep the logs on each reboot/shutdown see
.B systemd-journald.service(8)
