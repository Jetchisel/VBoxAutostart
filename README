------------------------------------------------------------------

The  VirtualBox  package  that is running in your system might or
does have an init script which is located in  /etc/init.d/*  such
as the vboxes, vboxautostart-service or you may have your own way
of doing the "autostart" of your virtual machines.  You will need
to  disable  them  if  you  suspect of any conflicts with VBoxAu-
tostart.

Since systemd is supposedly "faster" (yay!) than the legacy  sys-
temV init, there might be (or not) a time that VBoxAutostart will
start first before native service (init scripts)  of  VirtualBox,
therefore  you might  have some errors like "Could not find vbox-
drv" also if VBoxManage become's more versbose than  normal, among 
other things. If you suspected this you can add the vboxdrv kernel
module in /etc/sysconfig/kernel --> MODULES_LOADED_ON_BOOT.  Then 
run as root: /sbin/mkinitrd

The standard output of the unit VBoxAutostart  is  syslog+console
therefore  you  can  see it while booting and stopping your host.
If you have the silent flag in your /etc/default/grub you need to
press  the  <ESC>  key while booting and stopping your host.  You
can change the silent flag to  verbose  in  /etc/default/grub  by
editing  it. An example of doing it is running the following com-
mands are root.

 cp -v /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.orig

 ex -sc '%s/silent/verbose/ge|x' /etc/default/grub

 grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

------------------------------------------------------------------

If  you  want  to  run  your vms (without running it at the back-
ground) after logging in and with X server running you  can  edit
the  systemd-vboxinit script and replace headless with either gui
or sdl. You can call that script using your  ~/.xinitrc  file  or
some  DE  such  KDE  has  the  "autostart"  option  to  run  pro-
grams/scripts during log-in. You cannot run  systemd-vboxinit  in
the  background  if you have replaced headless with the other op-
tions. The daemon starts before the  X server so  your  vms  will
just crash and it makes no SENSE!

An example of editing the script:

Running it with the normal "gui" option.

  ex -sc '%s/headless/gui/ge|x' systemd-vboxinit

Running it with the "sdl" option.

  ex -sc '%s/headless/sdl/ge|x' systemd-vboxinit


Just be prepared to be met with your vms when you log-in :-)
Dont forget to disable the VBoxAutostart daemon!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For some convenience setting/getting extrada to your virtual  ma-
chines  copy the ExtraData script to your "$HOME"/bin and make it
executable. As a normal user run the following.

  cp -v ExtraData "$HOME"/bin

  chmod +x "$HOME"/bin/ExtraData

Now call the script.
