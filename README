--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The  VirtualBox  package  that is running in your system might or does have an init script 
which is mostly located in  /etc/init.d/*  such  as the vboxes,  vboxautostart-service or 
you may have your own way of doing the "autostart" of your virtual machines. You will need
to disable  them  if  you  suspect of any conflicts with VBoxAutostart.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since systemd  is supposedly "faster" (yay!) than the legacy  systemV init, there might be 
(or not) a time that VBoxAutostart will start first before native service (init scripts) 
of VirtualBox, therefore you might have some errors (or not) like "Could not find vboxdrv" 
also if VBoxManage become's more versbose than normal, among other things. If you suspected 
this,  add the vboxdrv kernel module in /etc/sysconfig/kernel --> MODULES_LOADED_ON_BOOT 
then run mkinitrd. An example of doing it is by running the command as root.

 cp -v /etc/sysconfig/kernel /etc/sysconfig/kernel.old

 printf '%s\n' 'g/MODULES_LOADED_ON_BOOT/s/"$/ vboxdrv"/' w | ed -s /etc/sysconfig/kernel

 /sbin/mkinitrd

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The standard output of the unit VBoxAutostart  is  syslog+console therefore  you  can  see it 
while booting and stopping your host. If you have the silent flag in your /etc/default/grub 
you need to press the <ESC>  key while booting and stopping your host. You can change the sil-
ent flag to  verbose  in /etc/default/grub  by editing  it. An example of doing it is running
the following commands as root.

 cp -v /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.orig

 ex -sc '%s/silent/verbose/ge|x' /etc/default/grub

 grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If  you  want  to  run  your vms (without running it at the background) after logging in and
with X server running you  can  edit the  systemd-vboxinit script and replace  headless with 
either gui or sdl. You can call that  script using your  ~/.xinitrc  file  or  some  DE  such  
KDE  has   the  "autostart"  option  to  run  programs/scripts  during log-in. You cannot run
systemd-vboxinit  in the  background  if you have replaced headless  with the  other  options. 
The daemon starts before the  X server so  your  vms  will just crash and it makes no SENSE!

An example of editing the script:

Running it with the normal "gui" option.

  ex -sc '%s/headless/gui/ge|x' systemd-vboxinit

Running it with the "sdl" option.

  ex -sc '%s/headless/sdl/ge|x' systemd-vboxinit


Just be prepared to be met with your vms when you log-in :-), Dont forget to disable the VBoxAu-
tostart daemon!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For some convenience setting/getting extrada to your virtual  machines  copy the ExtraData script
to your "$HOME"/bin and make it executable. As a normal user run the following.

  cp -v ExtraData "$HOME"/bin

  chmod +x "$HOME"/bin/ExtraData

Now call the script.

  ExtraData

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One more to thing to add is that you do not need to configure or edit some config files in order for 
your virtual machines to autostart and save state. Enable the VBoxAutostart daemon one  time as root 
or with your all time favorite sudo utility, as a normal user you can set the "auto" flag to the vir-
tual machines that you want to autostart and autosave and viola!
